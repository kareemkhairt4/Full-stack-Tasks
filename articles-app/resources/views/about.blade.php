    <h1>About ME</h1>
        <br>
       <h6> I'm Kareem Khairy! I'm a professional Full Stack Developer
            specialized in building high-performance websites for e-commerce
            platforms and marketing centers .

            I find great pleasure in learning and I care very much about
            understanding everything I do to the best of my ability. I don't like
            just copy/pasting or following some tutorial blindly. So, I've come
            to know my tools extremely well

            I don't just deliver code, but I deliver added value. Every line I
            write focuses on your business objectives: faster performance, a
            better user experience, and a robust backend that evolves with

            you, making your business more professional. I provide post
            launch support to maintain the security of your system, improve

            it, and prepare it for future growth - because I believe that your
            success does not stop at delivery but it starts from there.
